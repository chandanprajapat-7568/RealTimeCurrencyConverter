2. ABSTRACT
-----------

This project presents a Real-Time Currency Converter web application developed using Java Servlet and JSP technologies. The application enables users to convert currencies in real-time by utilizing the Frankfurter API, which provides current exchange rates for major world currencies. The web application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where JSP pages serve as the view layer, servlets as the controller, and external API as the model layer. The application features user-friendly input forms for specifying amounts and currency pairs, validates user inputs, handles API responses, and displays conversion results with appropriate error handling. Built with Java, Servlet API, JSP, and HTML/CSS frontend, the application demonstrates core web development concepts including HTTP request handling, JSON parsing, API integration, and proper error management. The application is compatible with both Tomcat and Glassfish application servers, providing flexibility in deployment environments. This project serves as a practical example of server-side web development using Java technologies while incorporating real-world data from external APIs.


3. INTRODUCTION
---------------

Background & Motivation:
In today's globalized economy, accurate and real-time currency conversion is essential for financial transactions, international trade, travel planning, and economic analysis. Traditional approaches to currency conversion often rely on outdated exchange rates or complex manual calculations. The need for an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly web-based currency converter has become increasingly important as businesses and individuals engage in cross-border activities.

The development of web-based applications has simplified access to real-time data, and Java Servlet and JSP technologies provide a robust platform for creating dynamic web applications. This project leverages these technologies to create a responsive currency converter that fetches real-time exchange rates from reliable API sources.

Problem Statement:
Manual currency conversion calculations are time-consuming, prone to errors, and rely on outdated exchange rates. Existing solutions may have complex user interfaces or require API keys for access. There is a need for a simple, efficient, and accessible currency converter that provides real-time exchange rates without complex setup requirements.

Objectives of the Project:
- To develop a web-based currency converter using Java Servlet and JSP technologies
- To integrate with a real-time currency exchange API (Frankfurter API) for accurate rates
- To implement proper input validation and error handling
- To create a user-friendly interface with responsive design
- To follow the MVC architectural pattern for clean code organization
- To ensure compatibility with multiple application servers (Tomcat and Glassfish)


4. METHODOLOGY
--------------

Technology Stack and Tools Used:

Backend Technologies:
- Java Servlet API (javax.servlet) - for handling HTTP requests and responses
- JavaServer Pages (JSP) - for dynamic content generation
- Maven - for project management and dependency management
- HTTPURLConnection - for API communication

Frontend Technologies:
- HTML5 - for structure and content
- CSS3 - for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript - for client-side validation (minimal)

Libraries and Dependencies:
- org.json - for JSON parsing
- JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) - for JSP functionality
- javax.servlet-api - for servlet functionality
- javax.servlet.jsp-api - for JSP functionality

Data Handling and Processing:

API Integration:
- Used Frankfurter API (https://api.frankfurter.app/latest) for real-time exchange rates
- Implemented HTTP GET requests to fetch currency conversion data
- Handled API responses in JSON format

Input Validation:
- Client-side validation using HTML5 form attributes
- Server-side validation for data type, range, and format checks
- Validation for required fields and numeric values

JSON Parsing:
- Used org.json library to parse API responses
- Extracted exchange rate data and date information
- Handled potential JSON parsing errors gracefully

Architecture and Design Pattern:
- Implemented MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern
- JSP pages serve as the View layer
- Servlet acts as the Controller layer
- External API functions as the Model layer
- Separation of concerns for maintainable code

Development Process:
1. Project Setup: Created Maven-based Java web application structure
2. API Integration: Researched and implemented Frankfurter API integration
3. Frontend Development: Created user interface using HTML/CSS
4. Backend Implementation: Developed servlet for processing requests
5. Testing: Conducted functionality and error handling testing
6. Deployment: Ensured compatibility with Tomcat and Glassfish servers


5. RESULTS & ANALYSIS
---------------------

System Functionality:
The Real-Time Currency Converter successfully performs currency conversions using live exchange rates from the Frankfurter API. The application demonstrates:

User Interface:
- Clean, responsive design with intuitive form layout
- Support for multiple currency pairs
- Real-time conversion results display
- Proper error messages for invalid inputs

Conversion Accuracy:
- Accurate conversion rates matching API data
- Support for major world currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, INR, etc.)
- Proper decimal precision for currency values

Performance:
- Fast API response handling
- Efficient JSON parsing
- Minimal processing overhead

Key Results:
- Successful API Integration: The application reliably fetches real-time currency data
- Input Validation: Comprehensive validation prevents invalid data processing
- Error Handling: Graceful handling of network errors and invalid inputs
- Cross-Server Compatibility: Works on both Tomcat and Glassfish servers

Technical Analysis:
The servlet efficiently handles HTTP POST requests, processes form data, makes external API calls, and manages request forwarding. The JSON parsing implementation successfully extracts conversion rates and provides accurate results to users.

User Experience Analysis:
The interface provides clear input fields, intuitive currency selection, and immediate feedback on conversion results. The responsive design ensures accessibility across different device types.


6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE
----------------------------

Summary of Findings:
The Real-Time Currency Converter project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a server-side web application using Java Servlet and JSP technologies. The application effectively integrates with external APIs, handles user input validation, processes data efficiently, and presents results in a user-friendly format. The MVC architectural pattern ensures clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

Key achievements include successful API integration with real-time exchange rates, robust error handling, responsive user interface, and cross-platform compatibility. The application meets all specified requirements and provides a practical solution for currency conversion needs.

Future Enhancements:
- Enhanced Currency Support: Include more currency pairs and minor currencies
- Historical Data: Provide historical exchange rate charts and trends
- Multiple Conversion: Allow conversion to multiple target currencies simultaneously
- User Preferences: Save user's preferred currency pairs
- Rate Alerts: Implement functionality to notify users when rates reach specific thresholds
- Mobile App: Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android
- Offline Mode: Cache recent exchange rates for offline usage
- Advanced Features: Include percentage calculations, comparison tools, and financial charts

Technical Improvements:
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
- Add security features like rate limiting and input sanitization
- Integrate with multiple API sources for redundancy
- Implement advanced logging and monitoring
- Add internationalization support for multiple languages
